This is a choice-based game using Twine.

I don&#x27;t want to spoil too much, so I will simply allow you to experience the game for yourself.

What you are about to play is a rough-build of the game. The game functions the way it is supposed to, but currently does not have aesthetics such as sound or advanced visuals. These will be in the final build of the game.


Everything that you will experience is subject to change, and you might experience errors or bugs. If this happens, please contact me at shanesedy@yahoo.com.

I am excited for you to play my creation, so please [[enjoy -&gt;Scene 1]]!</tw-passagedata></tw-storydata>
